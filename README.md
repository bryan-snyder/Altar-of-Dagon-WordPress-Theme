# Altar-of-Dagon-WordPress-Theme
I am creating this WordPress theme for the band I'm currently playing in **Altar of Dagon**. Not going to be much public interest here but I hope to grow it into a larger, more customizable, theme that can be distributed.

This WordPress theme will eventually reside here: [altarofdagon.com](http://altarofdagon.com)

As you can see, much work to be done. Going from a static build which I just recently added Bootstrap to so that it better performed on mobile devices.

I'm building this theme from scractch. Feel free to follow my progress and I'm always open to suggestions.

By the time I'm done building this, it will be a full start to finish WordPress Theme creation tutorial of sorts.

#Plugins:
At this point only Akismet is installed. I'm not going to track what plugin's I'm using, only ones I create myself that are necessary for the theme to function properly.

If you're dying to know if I'm using any third party plug-in's... check my .gitignore file, you'll see me blocking them.

# Altar-of-Dagon-WordPress-Theme
I am creating this WordPress theme for the band I'm currently playing in **Altar of Dagon**. Not going to be much public interest here but I hope to grow it into a larger, more customizable theme that can be distributed.

This WordPress theme will eventually reside here: [altarofdagon.com](http://altarofdagon.com)

As you can see, much work to be done. Going from a static build which I just recently added Bootstrap to so that it better performed on mobile devices.
I'm building this theme from scractch. Feel free to follow my progress and I'm always open to suggestions.
By the time I'm done building this, it will be a full start to finish WordPress Theme creation tutorial of sorts.

##Plan of attack:
To create a mobile first website for the band [**Altar of Dagon**](http://altarofdagon.com) I will be using the following technologies to create this theme:
  * [WordPress (obviously)](http://wordpress.org)
  * [BootStrap 3.3.6 CDN](http://getbootstrap.com) (until a stable release of BS4 is available)
  * HTML5/CSS3
  * PHP/MySQL
  * Javascript/jQuery
    * I may integrate Angular.js at a later date, will use with BootStrap rather than Material Design. (my personal preference)
  * [Font Awesome Icons CDN](http://fontawesome.io)
  * [Google Fonts CDN](https://www.google.com/fonts)
  * [wp-bootstrap-navwalker](https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker) (handles turning WP menus into BootStrap nav menus from dashboard)

##Plugins:
At this point only Akismet is installed. I'm not going to track what plugin's I'm using, only ones I create myself that are necessary for the theme to function properly.

If you're dying to know if I'm using any third party plug-in's... check my .gitignore file, you'll see me blocking them.

Here's what I plan to use:
  * Akismet
  * W3-Total-Cache
  * Yoast SEO
  * Events Made Easy (for concert dates, directions)

##Theme Customizer:
I will be creating theme customizer functions or plugins within this build. If you're looking to learn to create customizer "plug ins", I'll have some knowledge to share.
